# Lesson 1
* Open terminal
* ls “list”
* open .
* This is your file system, each item in your file system has an address that locates it on your computer. That address is called a **path**. We call folders ***directories**.
* pwd “print working directory”
* click and drag the Desktop
* follow the path to the desktop using cd
* cd ../
* mkdir MyFirstWebsite
	* different ways of naming files: **camel case, snake case, kebab case**. The point is, *(1) be consistent and (2) don’t use spaces (these are encoded)*.
* show them what happens when you use spaces
* rm -rv to delete extra folders
	* BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS
* cd MyFirstWebsite
	* use tab
* touch index.html
* .html is a **file extension**. It tells the computer what kind of file your file is, and what program to open it in. If you open that index file now, it will open in your default **browser**.
* touch assets
* touch style.css
* code .
