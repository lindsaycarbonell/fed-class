# Homework
1. Read through this: https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/basic-web-pages/
2. Build a "profile page" just with HTML tags. The page should have: your name, where you're from, your hobbies, and why you're taking this class. Feel free to add any other content you'd like and get creative with it! If you want an extra challenge, add an image with a link and make sure the link opens in a new tab. Here are some HTML tags that will be helpful in building your page:
- header tags (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)
- paragraph tags (`<p>`)
- image tags (`<img>`)
- list tags (`<ul>` and `<ol>`)
- emphasis (`<em>`) and `<strong>` tags (if you see `<i>` and `<b>` online, those are obsolete as of HTML5 but used to do basically the same thing)
- line break tags (`<br>`) (only use these if you're adding line breaks within a paragraph tag)
- horizontal rule tags (`<hr>`)
- If you're having trouble figuring out how to start building the profile page, here's a hint: create a new file called "index.html", open it in Visual Studio Code, then in the file type "html:5" (without the quotes) and press tab. To see what the file looks like, open it in a browser (like Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.). If you're still stuck, shoot me an email!

3. If you finish that early and want to read even further ahead, try these:
