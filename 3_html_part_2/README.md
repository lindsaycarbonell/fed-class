## Tables
A table represents data in two-dimensions (rows and columns). In the early days of the Internet, tables were used for page layouts because of their rigid structures and predictable syntax. Today we don't use tables for layouts, but they are still integral in representing tabular datasets.

### Your toolbox
* `<table>`: Represents the table.
* `<tr>`: Represents a table row within a table.
* `<td>`: Represents a cell (or table data) within the table.
* `<th>`: Represents a table header cell.
* `<tbody>`: Represents a block of rows that consist of a body of data for its parent table.
* `<thead>`: Represents the block of rows that consist of the column labels (headers) for its parent table.
* `<tfoot>`: Represents the block of rows that consist of the column summaries (footers) for the parent table.
* `<caption>`: Represents the title of its parent table.
* `<colgroup>`: Represents a group of one or more columns in its parent table.
* `<col>`: Used for specifying column properties for each column within a colgroup.
